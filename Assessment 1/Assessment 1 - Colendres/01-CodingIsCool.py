#Exercise 1: Coding is Cool
word1 = 'Coding' #In Python, this line of coding involves the application of assigning data to variables.
word2 = 'Is' #Variables are containers of data. Examples such as word1,word2, and word3. 
word3 = 'Cool' #Adding an = sign after a variable will allow us to store data in these containers.
print(f"{word1} {word2} {word3}") #Using f format allows us to use expressions in strings.
#With the use of print allows us to display these texts.
